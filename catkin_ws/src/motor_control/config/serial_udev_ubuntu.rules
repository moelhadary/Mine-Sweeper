# make symlinks serial0 and serial1, pointing to the default device names. Grant read/write permissions for the devices
# note: not sure if these actually ought to be tty, but this works.
# note2: this mapping from tty* to serial* is apparently the canonical one for RPI 3&4. Should not change this unless 
#   there's a super good reason to.
